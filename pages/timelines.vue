            <th>Timeline Description:</th>
            <td>
              Chronicles the true and unfiltered origins of the world of Eternum
              — including its creation, foundational truths, and the events that
              shaped the world long before the current story begins. This
              timeline is viewed as the objective account, not colored by
              personal perspective.
            </td>
            <td>
              Follows the daily life, inner thoughts, and monumental journey of
              Zigfrid Eternum Dahlia, known across the world as Zed, the First
              Devil. It presents the world through the eyes of a feared and
              misunderstood figure — unveiling the logic, burdens, and solitude
              behind the Devil’s legend.
            </td>
            <td>
              Offers a sharp, analytical view into the political mechanisms,
              societal structures, and governing forces that shape Eternum. Seen
              through the lens of Fimia Eternum, this timeline reveals the
              hidden gears behind major decisions and the ideologies driving the
              world forward — or pulling it apart.
            </td>
            <td>
              Explores the life of Riana Sunflower, a woman of high standing
              whose death leads to her rebirth as Solaria. Through her eyes, we
              see a rare contrast between two vastly different eras — the one
              she once ruled in, and the one she now awakens into. This timeline
              reflects on identity, legacy, and societal evolution across time.
            </td>
            <td>
              Documents the lives and discoveries of artificially created beings
              — Pandora or entities shaped by magic and purpose. It follows
              their struggles to find meaning, form relationships, and explore
              what it means to truly live in a world while navigating their
              inner working and purposes.
            </td>
            <td>
              Presents a grounded, often skeptical view of Eternum as
              experienced by Reon Clearheart, a being with ties to Earth or an
              Earth-like mindset. This timeline blends logic with fantasy,
              questioning the world’s strange laws, magical phenomena, and
              deeper truths — a narrative of curiosity, confusion, and
              adaptation.
            </td>
            <td>
              A chilling descent into the shadows through the eyes of Yuriya, a
              child taken in by a dark cult and raised under their twisted
              doctrine. Her timeline explores indoctrination, survival, and
              inner conflict — as she begins to question everything she was
              taught, and uncovers buried truths within the darkness.
            </td>
            <td>
              Follows the whimsical yet eye-opening journey of Videris Minx, a
              member of a mimic race and once the head of royal spies. After a
              fateful ceremony where he drinks the blood of an Eternum — his
              mentor — Videris becomes ageless and physically transformed.
              Choosing retirement, he sets off across the lands of Eternum,
              documenting cultures, customs, and curiosities with cheerful
              fascination and sharp insight. This timeline explores the common
              sense of the world: its daily life, unspoken rules, social
              nuances, and cultural diversity — all from the perspective of an
              expert observer who’s seen both shadows and sunlight.
